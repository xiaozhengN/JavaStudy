Java Concurrency Stress Tests

Rev: null, built by MLOONG with 16.0.1 at null

Burning up to figure out the exact CPU count....... done!

Probing the target OS:
 (all failures are non-fatal, but may affect testing accuracy)

----- [N/A] Trying to set global affinity with taskset
Cannot run program "taskset": CreateProcess error=2, 系统找不到指定的文件。
----- [N/A] Trying to set per-thread affinity with syscalls
Not implemented

Initializing and probing the target VM:
 (all failures are non-fatal, but may affect testing accuracy)

----- [OK] Unlocking diagnostic VM options
----- [OK] Disabling performance data collection
----- [OK] Checking for C1 availability
----- [OK] Checking for C2 availability
----- [OK] Trimming down the VM heap size to 256M
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of parallel GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of concurrent GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of G1 concurrent refinement GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of compiler threads
----- [OK] Testing @Contended works on all results and infra objects
----- [OK] Unlocking debug information for non-safepoints
----- [OK] Unlocking C2 local code motion randomizer
----- [OK] Unlocking C2 global code motion randomizer
----- [OK] Unlocking C2 iterative global value numbering randomizer
----- [N/A] Unlocking C2 conditional constant propagation randomizer
Unrecognized VM option 'StressCCP'
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.

----- [OK] Testing allocation profiling
----- [OK] Testing Thread.onSpinWait
----- [OK] Testing PrintAssembly
----- [OK] Testing compiler directives

Probing what VM configurations are available:
 (failures are non-fatal, but may miss some interesting cases)
 (split compilation is requested and compiler directives are available)

----- [OK] [-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions, -XX:+LogCompilation]
----- [OK] [-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions, -XX:+LogCompilation, -XX:+StressLCM, -XX:+StressGCM, -XX:+StressIGVN]

Detecting CPU topology and computing scheduling classes:
  Fallback topology, assuming reasonable defaults
  1 package, 8 cores per package, 1 thread per core

  CPU lists:
    Package #0, Core #0, Threads: 0
    Package #0, Core #1, Threads: 1
    Package #0, Core #2, Threads: 2
    Package #0, Core #3, Threads: 3
    Package #0, Core #4, Threads: 4
    Package #0, Core #5, Threads: 5
    Package #0, Core #6, Threads: 6
    Package #0, Core #7, Threads: 7

  Scheduling classes for matching tests:

  Test configuration:
    Test preset mode: "default"
    Hardware CPUs in use: 8
    Spinning style: Thread.onSpinWait()
    Test selection: "main.daily.Reordering.Case1"
    Forks per test: 1
    Iterations per fork: 5
    Time per iteration: 1000 ms
    Test stride: 40 strides x 256 tests, but taking no more than 128 Mb
    Test result blob: "jcstress-results-2022-11-19-19-04-39.bin.gz"
    Test results: "results/"

FATAL: No matching tests.
